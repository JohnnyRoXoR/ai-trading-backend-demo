# Conversation Summary – Trading Bots

During our discussions we explored how to monetize and publish our trading bots via GitHub. Key points include:

- Many existing repositories such as `ai-trading-coach`, `ai-optimizer-api`, `whale-alerts`, `scalper-pro-pack` and `white‑label‑telegram‑dashboard` were empty or contained only skeleton code. The only project with substantial code was **ai‑trading‑backend**, a simple FastAPI API for analyzing chart images and generating random trading recommendations.
- Another private repository, `rork‑ai‑crypto‑trading‑assistant`, contains a more complete TypeScript front end and back end, though it is not included in this demo.
- We suggested using GitHub Sponsors to collect donations and linking PayPal/BuyMeACoffee in `FUNDING.yml` files to display the Sponsor button on repository pages.
- For monetization, a **freemium** model was proposed: publish a free public version of each project and sell access to a premium version (for example, with real data or advanced features) via private repositories.
- We packaged multiple projects (SCAMHUNTER, LekoMapa, AI Content Pilot) as demos and created `.github/FUNDING.yml` in each to enable Sponsorship.
- The AI Trading Backend project included here demonstrates basic functionality and can serve as a template for building more advanced bots.
